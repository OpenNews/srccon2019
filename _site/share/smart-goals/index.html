<h1 id="setting-smart-goals">Setting SMART goals</h1>

<p>The exercises that follow are meant to help you define your vision then create SMART goals to help you achieve that vision.</p>

<p>You may want to use these exercises if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You learned a new skill and you want to make sure you keep using it, and continuing to apply it over time</li>
  <li>You see potential for change in your team’s work and you want to hold yourselves accountable toward that growth</li>
  <li>You want to make a cultural shift in your organization and you need some tangible milestones to help get the ball rolling</li>
</ul>

<p>SMART goals is a framework often used to help folks gain clarity in their vision, then make an actionable plan to help them get on their way toward realizing that vision.</p>

<p>The S stands for <strong>specific</strong>. This means you want to be specific in naming your goal and what you want to achieve. An example could be: “I want to save more of my paycheck to build up a rainy day fund.”</p>

<p>The M stands for <strong>measurable</strong>. This means you will identify your key metrics to help you understand whether or not you have been successful. An example could be: “I want to save enough of my paycheck to build up a rainy day fund that would cover my rent, utilities, and living expenses for six months.”</p>

<p>The A stands for <strong>achievable</strong>. This means you are being realistic about the current conditions under which you exist and will continue to exist while working toward your goal. An example of this could be: “Given my monthly budget, I believe I can set aside an additional 4% of my paycheck each month toward the goal of building up a six-months rainy day fund.”</p>

<p>The R stands for <strong>relevant</strong>. This means that you clearly understand how your goals support your overall vision. An example could be: “Because I work in journalism, where employment conditions are volatile, if I build up my six-months rainy day fund, then I won’t have to worry as much about money if I lose my job.”</p>

<p>Finally, the T stands for <strong>timebound</strong>. This means that you are setting a deadline for yourself by using this model. An example of this could be: “If I follow the plan of setting aside 4% of my paycheck for 12 months, I will have saved enough to cover six months of my rent, utilities, and living expenses.”</p>

<h2 id="visioning-and-goal-setting">Visioning and Goal Setting</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What big, blue sky goals do you have? Write down several ideas and circle the one that speaks most clearly to you. (Don’t worry about those other goals — you can always repeat this exercise again later to build out a SMART goals plan for those too).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe your starting point with respect to your goal.  List as much information as possible, so you know where you are starting from. Ask yourself questions like:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>What resources are available to me?</li>
  <li>What constraints and challenges do I face?</li>
  <li>How will I know if I have been successful?</li>
  <li>Who can help support me?</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>What is your vision of success? Describe what the future would be like if you were successful with your goal. Be as specific as possible. Ask yourself questions like:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>What is different on success day compared to today?</li>
  <li>How will I celebrate?</li>
  <li>How will I feel?</li>
  <li>What challenges that you currently face will have been defeated?</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What obstacles do you anticipate in trying to reach this goal? List all potential blockers. (These could include your own fears, perceptions)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What SMART goal(s) can you set to achieve that vision?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>S - Specific, M - Measurable, A - Achievable, R - Relevant, T - Timebound</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What milestones do you need to reach in order to achieve your SMART goal? And how will you hold yourself accountable as you reach those targets?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make a list of 100 actions you can take to make progress toward your goal. Yes, you read that correctly: 100 steps you can take. For example:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Items 1-5 could be “research 5 financial advisors on LinkedIn”</li>
  <li>Items 6-10 could be “email those 5 financial advisors and ask for their rates.”</li>
  <li>It also helps if you assign a timebox to each task: 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, etc. If your list is organized by timed tasks, you will always be able to find something to do to make progress toward your goal, no matter how little time you have.</li>
</ul>
